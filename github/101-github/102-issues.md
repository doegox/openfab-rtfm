# 102 Issues

## How to participate to a project

> “Always start with an issue” says Job, VP of Product here at GitLab. Before you begin anything else, summarize your ideas in an issue and share it. It’s such a simple rule, but the impact is huge.

Issues can have endless applications. Just to exemplify, these are some cases for which creating issues are most used:

* Discussing the implementation of a new idea
* Submitting feature proposals
* Asking questions
* Reporting bugs and malfunction
* Obtaining support  


  **Homework:**

* Start by watching this: [1.4: GitHub Issues - Git and GitHub for Poets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMykv2ZMyEQ)
* Then let's check that: You can start by browsing issues from **Openfab-lab/openfab** repository, here: [https://github.com/openfab-lab/openfab/issues](https://github.com/openfab-lab/openfab/issues)

1. You can post a comment to react on any issues, juts look for this at the end of page:

2. To finish, just create your own issue to present yourself. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12049360/50149106-91838900-02ba-11e9-99e0-ac55fd3fc080.png)

It's always nice to let the community know a bit more about you, explain a bit why you want to join and on what you want to help.

When creating an new issues, there is a template in place to help you organize your thought. Like that:

```text
Please use this format, which is intended to keep things simple and focused

The point is to make the Issue well-defined for everyone involved: 
- it identifies the audience and context (or user), 
- the problem or outcome wished. (or goal)
- the action (or task), and in some case,
- the outcome of a win/win situation (or Result/reward) as simply as possible.

this part is to be deleted when first edit...
