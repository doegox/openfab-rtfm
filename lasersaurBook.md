Members have to note their timing in the book, hanging on the right side.   
`Please, be thorough and readable`  
`Please, round to 1/2 hour`  
`Please and thank you`  
`Remember to be excellent to each other`  
`Clean your shit when done`

**To pay what you owe:**  
- `cash`, (to the [sheriff]() of the lab)
- `credits`, (should be linked to a commit on your lootcrate _or to your openfab "wallet"_)
- `facture`, (+ invoice number. If no number; then [create the invoice](); and report the number here)

`The line is crossed when it's paid and validated.`
