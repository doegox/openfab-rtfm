**Know the hazards associated with your work.**  Be sure you are fully educated on the proper use and operation of any tool before beginning a job.  If you cannot do a job safely in the **FAB**LAB, donâ€™t do it.  Think through the entire job before starting

**Hand tools** are non-powered tools. They include wrenches, hammers, chisels, screw drivers, and other hand-operated mechanisms. Even though hand tool injuries tend to be less severe than power tool injuries, hand tool injuries are more common. Because people take everyday hand tools for granted, simple precautions for safety are easily forgotten.

**Power tools** can be extremely dangerous if they are used improperly. Common accidents associated with power tools include abrasions, cuts, lacerations, amputations, burns, electrocutions, and broken bones.
